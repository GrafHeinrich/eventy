# Eventy

My first discord bot.

I need a simple way to vote for days when everyone has time to run an event (e.g. for a round of D&D).
The bot should manage the voting and create an event in Discord for coordinated days.
Furthermore, the bot should announce at certain intervals that an event takes place.

### Current Status: Basic bot structure with commands from the official discord.js tutorial

## Development
Get started developing by creating a `config.json` file and filling in these values:
```
{
	"token": "your-token-goes-here",
	"clientId": "your-application-id-goes-here",
	"guildId": "your-server-id-goes-here"
}
```
